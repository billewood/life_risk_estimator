# Real Data Download Guide

The application attempts to automatically download and parse the required datasets from official sources at startup. If a source is temporarily unavailable or blocked (e.g., rate limiting, CAPTCHA), use the manual fallback steps below.

## Required Data Files

The calculator requires these specific files in the backend `data_sources/` directory:

1. `ssa_life_tables_manual.csv`
2. `cdc_cause_death_manual.csv` 
3. `gbd_risk_factors_manual.json`

## 1. SSA Life Tables Download

### Source: Social Security Administration
**URL**: https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html

### Steps:
1. Visit the SSA life tables page
2. Find the most recent period life table (2021 or later)
3. Extract the data showing age-specific mortality rates
4. Create a CSV file with these columns:
   - `age`: Age (0-110)
   - `male_qx`: 1-year probability of death for males
   - `female_qx`: 1-year probability of death for females

### Example format:
```csv
age,male_qx,female_qx
0,0.006400,0.005400
1,0.000400,0.000300
2,0.000300,0.000200
...
```

## 2. CDC Cause of Death Data

### Source: CDC WONDER or NCHS Data Portal
**URL**: https://wonder.cdc.gov/

### Steps:
1. Access CDC WONDER mortality database
2. Query for cause-specific death rates by age group
3. Extract percentages for top causes of death by age group
4. Create a CSV file with these columns:
   - `age_group`: Age groups (0-1, 1-4, 5-14, 15-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65-74, 75-84, 85+)
   - `heart_disease_pct`: Percentage of deaths from heart disease
   - `cancer_pct`: Percentage of deaths from cancer
   - `accidents_pct`: Percentage of deaths from accidents
   - `stroke_pct`: Percentage of deaths from stroke
   - `diabetes_pct`: Percentage of deaths from diabetes

### Example format:
```csv
age_group,heart_disease_pct,cancer_pct,accidents_pct,stroke_pct,diabetes_pct
0-1,1.2,2.5,15.3,0.1,0.1
1-4,2.1,8.2,25.4,0.2,0.1
5-14,3.5,12.1,35.2,0.5,0.2
...
```

### Save as: `/Users/williamwood/Code/life-risk-app/backend/data_sources/cdc_cause_death_manual.csv`

## 3. Global Burden of Disease Risk Factors

### Source: Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)
**URL**: https://www.healthdata.org/data-tools-practices/interactive-visuals/gbd-results

### Steps:
1. Access the GBD Results Tool
2. Search for relative risk estimates for major risk factors
3. Extract data for: smoking, blood pressure, BMI, physical activity, alcohol
4. Create a JSON file with relative risk estimates

### Example format:
```json
{
  "smoking": {
    "current_vs_never": 2.5,
    "former_vs_never": 1.2,
    "years_to_never_equivalent": 15
  },
  "blood_pressure": {
    "per_20mmhg_sbp": 1.8,
    "treatment_reduction": 0.7
  },
  "bmi": {
    "per_5_units": 1.15,
    "optimal_range": [18.5, 24.9]
  },
  "fitness": {
    "per_met": 0.85,
    "sedentary_vs_active": 1.4
  },
  "alcohol": {
    "moderate_vs_none": 0.9,
    "heavy_vs_none": 1.3,
    "binge_vs_none": 1.2
  }
}
```

### Save as: `/Users/williamwood/Code/life-risk-app/backend/data_sources/gbd_risk_factors_manual.json`

## Alternative Data Sources

If the primary sources are inaccessible, consider these alternatives (the app will try multiple programmatic strategies before falling back to manual):

### CDC Alternative Sources:
- **NCHS Data Portal**: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/vitalstatsonline.htm
- **Mortality Multiple Cause Files**: Direct download of mortality data
- **Life Expectancy Reports**: Published annual reports with life tables

### GBD Alternative Sources:
- **Published Papers**: Search for GBD 2019 papers with relative risk estimates
- **Supplementary Materials**: Many GBD papers include detailed relative risk data
- **Meta-analyses**: Use systematic reviews for risk factor estimates

## Data Validation

Once automatically fetched or manually downloaded, the calculator will:
1. **Validate file structure**: Check required columns exist
2. **Log data sources**: Record provenance and integrity hashes
3. **Verify data ranges**: Ensure values are within expected ranges
4. **Cross-reference**: Compare with published statistics for validation

## Running with Real Data

After automatic fetch succeeds (or after manually downloading the files):

```bash
cd /Users/williamwood/Code/life-risk-app
python main.py
```

The calculator will:
- Process your downloaded files
- Validate data structure
- Log all data usage
- Perform mortality risk calculations with real data

## Important Notes

- **No placeholder data**: The calculator only works with real data from official sources (automatically fetched when possible)
- **Complete logging**: All data usage is tracked and logged
- **Data integrity**: Files are hashed to ensure no modifications
- **Source attribution**: Full provenance tracking for transparency

**Ready to process real data once you've downloaded the required files!**
